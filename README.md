# Picture Pad Flex Morpher

## Description

A simple, playful project for amusement, exploration, and learning.
I created Picture Pad Flex Morpher during self-study of JS, HTML, and CSS prior to any formal learning. It was a natural progression from the [Nonsense Pad](https://github.com/pablisch/nonsense-pad-sampler) project.

The premise of the app is an innovative way to view a collection of photos, e.g. from a holiday or a portfolio.
Due to the number of photos, they each occupy a small space on the screen but hovering over a photo will expend that photos row and column so it becomes the focus photo.
The dilemma, largely intentional, is that the focus photo is large and therefore most likely to be hovered over. The shifting sizes can make it hard to find a photo in particular making the browsing experience more of a game and exploration than a simple photo viewer.
